# Crystal-Collector-Game

In this project, a simple javascript game allows the user to select one of three crystals, each that have a number between 1-29 assigned to it.  They will then try to match the target score for that game, also which randomly is assigned each game.  If the user goes over the target score then the game ends, and the target number will be reset as well.  Good luck!
